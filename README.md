# TRIO
Tensor Regression for Incomplete Observations (TRIO) with Application to Longitudinal Studies

Main Functions:\
TRIO.m: This is a function to conduct TRIO regression.\
TRIO_corr.m: This is an internal function to conduct TRIO with variance/covariance matrix.\
test.m: To test and show examples of the TRIO functions.

Functions used in simulation:\
randcorr.m, ten_mat.m: Helping functions.\
simulation.m: Codes for the simulation study. 

Additional folders:\
tensor_toolbox-v3.4: tensor toolbox for Matlab (necessary for TRIO)\
SLEP-master: Sparse Learning with Efficient Projections toolbox for Matlab (necessary for TRIO)\
DISCOM: DISCOM method\
CP regression: TensorReg toolbox for CP regression
